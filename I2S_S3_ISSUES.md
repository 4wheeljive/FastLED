# ESP32-S3 I2S Compilation Issues and Fixes

## Issue Description

The ESP32-S3 Blink example compilation was failing with the following error:

```
src/third_party/yves/I2SClockLessLedDriver/src/I2SClockLessLedDriver.h:685:35: error: 'gdma_channel_alloc_config_t::<unnamed struct>' has no non-static data member named 'isr_cache_safe'
```

## Root Cause

The newer ESP-IDF version (used by the platform) has removed the `isr_cache_safe` field from the `gdma_channel_alloc_config_t` structure. The third-party I2S driver code was still trying to initialize this deprecated field.

## Fix Applied

**File**: `src/third_party/yves/I2SClockLessLedDriver/src/I2SClockLessLedDriver.h`
**Line**: 685

**Before**:
```cpp
gdma_channel_alloc_config_t dma_chan_config = {
    .sibling_chan = NULL,
    .direction = GDMA_CHANNEL_DIRECTION_TX,
    .flags = {
        .reserve_sibling = 0,
    .isr_cache_safe= true}};
```

**After**:
```cpp
gdma_channel_alloc_config_t dma_chan_config = {
    .sibling_chan = NULL,
    .direction = GDMA_CHANNEL_DIRECTION_TX,
    .flags = {
        .reserve_sibling = 0}};
```

## Result

After removing the unsupported `isr_cache_safe` field, the ESP32-S3 Blink example compiles successfully. The compilation completes with only deprecation warnings (expected with newer ESP-IDF versions) but no errors.

## Additional Warnings (Non-blocking)

The following warnings remain but do not prevent compilation:
- Deprecated `driver/periph_ctrl.h` header usage
- `MIN` macro redefinition warning  
- Deprecated `gdma_new_channel` function (should use `gdma_new_ahb_channel` or `gdma_new_axi_channel`)
- Narrowing conversion warning in ISR handler

These warnings indicate areas for future improvement but do not block current functionality.
