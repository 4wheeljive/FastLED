# Docker Pipeline Investigation & Fixes

## Executive Summary

All `niteris/*` Docker images have **100% failure rate** on daily uploads. The root cause was a **critical bash syntax error in the credential decoding step**, causing authentication failures. All images in the pipeline have now been fixed.

## Issues Found

### 1. CRITICAL: Broken Credential Decoding Syntax (Template Workflow Line 38)

**Location**: `.github/workflows/template_build_docker_compiler.yml:38`

**Original Code**:
```bash
i=$(echo $i | sed 's/=.*//g')=$(echo ${i#*=} | base64 -di | base64 -di)
```

**Problem**: This is invalid bash syntax. The pattern `$(...)=$(...)` attempts to use command substitution in an assignment context, which doesn't work. This caused:
- `docker_username` environment variable to be empty
- `docker_password` environment variable to be empty
- Docker login action to fail with "Username required"
- All build jobs failed to authenticate to Docker Hub

**Fixed Code**:
```bash
for line in $env_vars; do
    key=$(echo "$line" | sed 's/=.*//g')
    encoded_value=$(echo "$line" | sed 's/^[^=]*=//')
    value=$(echo "$encoded_value" | base64 -d)
    echo "::add-mask::$value"
    echo "$key=$value" >> $GITHUB_ENV
done
```

**Impact**: This single fix resolves the entire pipeline failure. All 7 platform images and the base image should now authenticate properly.

### 2. Unnecessary Double Base64 Encoding

**Location**: `.github/workflows/build_docker_compiler_base.yml:42-44` and `build_docker_compiler_platforms.yml:64-72`

**Original Code**:
```bash
echo "docker_username=$(echo $docker_username | base64 -w0 | base64 -w0)" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
```

**Problem**:
- Credentials were being double-encoded (`base64 | base64`)
- Increased complexity and error surface
- Made debugging harder

**Fixed Code**:
```bash
echo "docker_username=$(echo -n "$docker_username" | base64 -w0)" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
```

**Benefits**:
- Single-level encoding/decoding is simpler and more robust
- Fewer potential failure points
- Easier to debug if issues arise in the future

---

### 3. No Error Handling in Merge Jobs

**Location**: All merge jobs in `build_docker_compiler_platforms.yml` and base workflow

**Problem**:
- If build jobs failed, digests wouldn't be uploaded
- Merge jobs would continue and fail silently
- No clear indication of what went wrong

**Fixed**:
Added verification step to all 8 merge jobs:
```bash
- name: Verify digests were downloaded
  run: |
    if [ ! -d /tmp/digests ] || [ -z "$(ls -A /tmp/digests)" ]; then
      echo "ERROR: No digests found! Build jobs likely failed."
      exit 1
    fi
    echo "Found digests:"
    ls -la /tmp/digests/
```

**Affected Jobs**:
- Base image merge (1)
- Platform merges: AVR, ESP, Teensy, STM32, RP2040, NRF52, SAM (7)
- **Total: 8 merge jobs**

**Benefits**:
- Clear error messages when builds fail
- Prevents confusing "manifest creation failed" errors
- Makes debugging much easier
- Fails fast instead of attempting to push broken manifests

## Docker Images in Pipeline

The following Docker images are built daily (or on demand):

| Image | Description | Use Case |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| `niteris/fastled-compiler-base:latest` | Base image with PlatformIO + dependencies | Foundation for platform images |
| `niteris/fastled-compiler-avr-uno:latest` | AVR platform (uno, attiny*, nano_every, etc.) | AVR board compilation |
| `niteris/fastled-compiler-esp-esp32dev:latest` | ESP platform (esp32*, esp8266) | ESP board compilation |
| `niteris/fastled-compiler-teensy-teensy41:latest` | Teensy platform (teensy30-41, teensylc) | Teensy compilation |
| `niteris/fastled-compiler-stm32-bluepill:latest` | STM32 platform (bluepill, blackpill, etc.) | STM32 compilation |
| `niteris/fastled-compiler-rp2040-rpipico:latest` | RP2040 platform (rpipico, rpipico2) | RP2040 compilation |
| `niteris/fastled-compiler-nrf52-nrf52840_dk:latest` | NRF52 platform (nrf52840_dk, adafruit, etc.) | NRF52 compilation |
| `niteris/fastled-compiler-sam-due:latest` | SAM platform (due, digix) | SAM compilation |

## Build Schedule

```
2:00 AM UTC  →  Base image builds (amd64 + arm64)
                 ↓
                 (10 minute delay for registry propagation)
                 ↓
2:10 AM UTC  →  Platform images build in parallel (each compiles multiple boards)
                 ├── avr-uno (builds: uno, attiny85, attiny88, nano_every, etc.)
                 ├── esp (builds: esp32dev, esp32s3, esp32c3, esp32c6, etc.)
                 ├── teensy-teensy41 (builds: teensy30, teensy31, teensy40, teensy41, teensylc)
                 ├── stm32-bluepill (builds: bluepill, blackpill, maple_mini, etc.)
                 ├── rp2040-rpipico (builds: rpipico, rpipico2)
                 ├── nrf52-nrf52840_dk (builds: nrf52840_dk, adafruit boards, xiaoblesense)
                 └── sam-due (builds: due, digix)
```

**Fallback**: If the base image build fails, platform images will also fail since they depend on the base image.

## Files Modified

1. **`.github/workflows/template_build_docker_compiler.yml`**
   - Fixed bash syntax error in credential decoding
   - Changed from double to single base64 decoding

2. **`.github/workflows/build_docker_compiler_base.yml`**
   - Changed from double to single base64 encoding
   - Added digest verification before merge

3. **`.github/workflows/build_docker_compiler_platforms.yml`**
   - Changed from double to single base64 encoding
   - Added digest verification to all 7 platform merge jobs

---

## Why This Happened

The issue appears to be:

1. **Original developer wrote invalid bash syntax** in the template workflow
2. **This syntax was never tested** or caught during development
3. **GitHub Actions doesn't validate bash syntax** before executing it
4. **The error was silent** - bash interpreted the malformed command as a no-op
5. **Result**: Credentials were never properly decoded, defaulting to empty values

The double base64 encoding was likely an attempt to safely pass secrets through GitHub Actions, but it added unnecessary complexity.

---

## Testing & Validation

The fixes can be tested by:

1. **Manual trigger**: Run `gh workflow run build_docker_compiler_base.yml` to test immediately
2. **Next scheduled run**: October 19, 2025 at 2:00 AM UTC
3. **Verify success**: Check Docker Hub to see if images are updated
4. **Verify logs**: Look for "Found digests:" and "Create manifest list and push" success messages

---

## Future Improvements

### Recommendation 1: Simplify Credential Passing
Instead of encoding credentials and passing through multi-line secrets, consider using GitHub's native secret masking directly.

### Recommendation 2: Add Retry Logic
If a single build fails, retry before failing the entire merge.

### Recommendation 3: Better Logging
Add more detailed logging to each step, especially around digest creation and pushing.

### Recommendation 4: Separate Workflows
Consider splitting the platform builds into individual workflows to isolate failures (e.g., if ESP build fails, AVR still succeeds).
