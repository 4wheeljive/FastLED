"""
File Locking API Wrapper with Stale Lock Detection

Provides a unified, simplified API for inter-process file locking.
Wraps the fasteners library with PID-based stale lock detection and auto-recovery.

Features:
- Fine-grained per-resource locking
- 5-second default timeout for download operations
- PID tracking to detect crashed processes
- Automatic stale lock recovery
- Cross-platform (Windows/Linux/macOS)
