# JSON Implementation Bug Analysis

## Fixed Issues

### 1. Floating-Point Comparison in Tests
Fixed a test failure in `test_json_new.cpp` where floating-point comparison was failing due to precision issues. 
Changed `REQUIRE(doubleResult == 3.14)` to `REQUIRE(doubleResult == doctest::Approx(3.14))` to properly handle 
floating-point comparisons in tests.

## Current Status

The `json_new` implementation is passing all tests. The implementation provides:
- A clean variant-based JSON value type
- Proper type checking methods (`is_null()`, `is_bool()`, `is_int()`, `is_double()`, `is_string()`, `is_array()`, `is_object()`)
- Safe extraction methods with `fl::optional` return types
- Fluid indexing with `operator[]` for both arrays and objects
- Default-value operator (`|`) for safe value extraction with fallbacks
- JSON parsing and serialization functionality

## Implementation Details

The `json_new` implementation follows the design principles outlined in the document, with:
1. A single recursive node type built on `fl::variant`
2. Proper encapsulation using smart pointers for array and object elements
3. Complete API with type checking, safe extraction, and indexing operations
4. Integration with FLArduinoJson for parsing and serialization while hiding implementation details

## Test Status

All tests for the `json_new` functionality are passing:
- Parsing of simple JSON values (null, boolean, integer, float, string)
- Array parsing and indexing
- Object parsing and key-based access
- Default value handling with the pipe operator

## Next Steps

1. Continue expanding test coverage for edge cases
2. Add benchmarks to compare performance with the older JSON implementation
3. Consider adding more convenience methods for common JSON operations
4. Document the API for users
