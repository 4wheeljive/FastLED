# Advanced Effects

This section covers advanced techniques and patterns for creating sophisticated LED effects with FastLED.

## Contents

- [2D/Matrix Operations](matrix.md) - Working with LED matrices and grids, including XY mapping and 2D patterns
- [Audio Reactive Patterns](audio.md) - Creating visualizations that respond to audio input
- [Multiple Strip Coordination](multi-strip.md) - Controlling and synchronizing multiple LED strips
- [Performance Optimization](optimization.md) - Tips and techniques for smooth, efficient animations

## Overview

Advanced effects build on the fundamental concepts from the previous sections to create more complex and visually impressive patterns. These techniques often involve:

- **Spatial mapping** - Converting 2D or 3D coordinates to linear LED arrays
- **Real-time data processing** - Responding to external inputs like audio or sensors
- **Multi-strip coordination** - Managing multiple LED controllers simultaneously
- **Optimization** - Ensuring smooth performance even with complex calculations

## Prerequisites

Before diving into advanced effects, you should be familiar with:

- Basic LED control (solid colors, simple animations)
- Color theory (RGB and HSV color models)
- Intermediate techniques (palettes, noise functions, blending)
- Frame rate management and timing

## Getting Help

If you encounter issues with advanced effects:

1. Check the [Troubleshooting](../troubleshooting/) section
2. Review the relevant subsection in this directory
3. Test with simpler versions of your effect first
4. Monitor frame rate and memory usage
