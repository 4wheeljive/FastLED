# Basic Patterns

This section covers fundamental LED patterns that form the building blocks of more complex effects. These patterns are perfect for beginners and demonstrate core FastLED concepts.

## Contents

1. [Solid Colors](solid-colors.md) - Fill strips with single colors
2. [Animations](animations.md) - Simple fade in/out effects
3. [Chases](chases.md) - Moving patterns and scanner effects
4. [Rainbow](rainbow.md) - Rainbow and color cycling effects

## Prerequisites

Before working with these patterns, make sure you've completed the basic FastLED setup:

```cpp
#include <FastLED.h>

#define LED_PIN     5
#define NUM_LEDS    60
#define LED_TYPE    WS2812B
#define COLOR_ORDER GRB

CRGB leds[NUM_LEDS];

void setup() {
    FastLED.addLeds<LED_TYPE, LED_PIN, COLOR_ORDER>(leds, NUM_LEDS);
    FastLED.setBrightness(50);  // 0-255
}
```

## Pattern Categories

### Solid Colors
Learn how to fill your LED strip with solid colors using FastLED's efficient fill functions. These are the most basic operations you'll use in every project.

### Animations
Simple animations that demonstrate timing and state management. The fade in/out effect teaches you how to create smooth transitions using brightness control.

### Chases and Scanners
Moving patterns that show off trail effects and position tracking. The classic Cylon/Knight Rider scanner is a great introduction to animation loops.

### Rainbow Effects
Colorful effects using HSV color space. Learn the difference between static and animated rainbow patterns, and why HSV makes color cycling easy.

## Learning Path

1. Start with **Solid Colors** to understand basic LED control
2. Move to **Animations** to learn timing and state management
3. Try **Chases** to explore movement and trails
4. Experiment with **Rainbow** effects to master HSV color space

Each pattern builds on concepts from the previous ones, so following this order is recommended for beginners.
