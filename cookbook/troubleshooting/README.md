## Quick Troubleshooting Checklist

Before diving into specific guides, verify these basics:

- [ ] Power supply voltage correct (5V for most strips)
- [ ] Power supply capacity sufficient (60mA per LED at full white)
- [ ] Data pin in code matches physical wiring
- [ ] LED type correct (WS2812B, APA102, etc.)
- [ ] COLOR_ORDER correct for your strip (try GRB if RGB doesn't work)
- [ ] Ground shared between microcontroller and LED strip
- [ ] `FastLED.show()` being called in your code
- [ ] Brightness not set to 0
- [ ] Strip not physically damaged

## Getting Help

If you're still stuck after reviewing these resources:

1. Double-check your wiring against the diagrams in [Hardware Problems](hardware.md)
2. Run the comprehensive hardware test in [Debugging Tips](debugging.md)
3. Check the [FastLED community forums](https://www.reddit.com/r/FastLED/)
4. Review the main [FastLED documentation](https://fastled.io)
