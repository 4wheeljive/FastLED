## Code Examples by Type

### WS2812B / NeoPixel

```cpp
#define LED_TYPE WS2812B
#define COLOR_ORDER GRB
FastLED.addLeds<LED_TYPE, DATA_PIN, COLOR_ORDER>(leds, NUM_LEDS);
```

**Characteristics:**
- Single data wire (no clock)
- 800 KHz data rate
- Most common and widely available
- Good for most applications
- Budget-friendly

### APA102 / DotStar

```cpp
#define LED_TYPE APA102
#define COLOR_ORDER BGR
FastLED.addLeds<LED_TYPE, DATA_PIN, CLOCK_PIN, COLOR_ORDER>(leds, NUM_LEDS);
```

**Characteristics:**
- Separate clock and data lines
- Much faster refresh rates (up to 20 MHz)
- Better color accuracy
- Good for long cable runs
- More expensive than WS2812B

### SK6812 (RGBW)

```cpp
// Note: FastLED doesn't natively support RGBW, use workaround:
#define LED_TYPE SK6812
#define COLOR_ORDER GRB
FastLED.addLeds<LED_TYPE, DATA_PIN, COLOR_ORDER>(leds, NUM_LEDS);
```

**Characteristics:**
- Similar to WS2812B
- RGBW variant available (adds white channel)
- Good for white light applications
- FastLED treats as RGB only

### WS2813

```cpp
#define LED_TYPE WS2813
#define COLOR_ORDER GRB
FastLED.addLeds<LED_TYPE, DATA_PIN, COLOR_ORDER>(leds, NUM_LEDS);
```

**Characteristics:**
- Backup data line for reliability
- Compatible with WS2812B protocol
- More robust than WS2812B
- Single LED failure won't break chain

## Color Order Reference

Different LED types use different color orders:

```cpp
// Common orders:
GRB  // WS2812B, WS2813, most strips
RGB  // Some WS2811, APA106
BGR  // APA102, SK9822
BRG  // Rare
```

### Testing Color Order

```cpp
void testColorOrder() {
    leds[0] = CRGB(255, 0, 0);  // Should show RED
    leds[1] = CRGB(0, 255, 0);  // Should show GREEN
    leds[2] = CRGB(0, 0, 255);  // Should show BLUE
    FastLED.show();

    // If wrong, try different COLOR_ORDER in setup
}
```

## Choosing LED Type

### Use WS2812B when:

- Budget-friendly option needed
- Single data wire preferred
- Speed isn't critical (<400 Hz refresh)
- Most common and compatible

**Pros:**
- Inexpensive
- Widely available
- Single wire simplicity
- Good community support

**Cons:**
- Timing-sensitive
- Slower refresh rates
- Less reliable over long distances

### Use APA102 when:

- Need higher refresh rates (>400 Hz)
- Want better color accuracy
- Have SPI pins available
- Need longer cable runs

**Pros:**
- Very fast refresh
- Separate clock line (more reliable)
- Better signal integrity
- Not timing-critical

**Cons:**
- More expensive
- Requires 2 wires (data + clock)
- Uses more pins on microcontroller

### Use SK6812 when:

- Need RGBW (true white) capability
- Want WS2812B compatibility
- Working with white light displays

**Pros:**
- RGBW variants available
- Compatible with WS2812B code
- Good white light quality

**Cons:**
- Limited FastLED RGBW support
- Slightly more expensive than WS2812B

### Use WS2813 when:

- Need reliability in long installations
- Want backup data line feature
- Concerned about single LED failures

**Pros:**
- Backup data line (more robust)
- WS2812B compatible
- Chain continues if LED fails

**Cons:**
- More expensive than WS2812B
- Still timing-sensitive like WS2812B

## Wiring Guidelines

### Single Wire LEDs (WS2812B, SK6812, WS2813)

```
Microcontroller GPIO ──[220Ω resistor]──> LED Strip DATA
Microcontroller GND  ───────────────────> LED Strip GND
Power Supply 5V      ───────────────────> LED Strip VCC
Power Supply GND     ───────────────────> LED Strip GND + MCU GND
```

### Clock + Data LEDs (APA102, SK9822)

```
Microcontroller MOSI ──[220Ω resistor]──> LED Strip DATA
Microcontroller SCK  ──[220Ω resistor]──> LED Strip CLOCK
Microcontroller GND  ───────────────────> LED Strip GND
Power Supply 5V      ───────────────────> LED Strip VCC
Power Supply GND     ───────────────────> LED Strip GND + MCU GND
```

## Common Issues

### Wrong Colors Displayed

**Problem**: LEDs show incorrect colors
**Solution**: Try different `COLOR_ORDER` values (GRB, RGB, BGR, etc.)

### First LED Flickers or Wrong

**Problem**: First LED unreliable
**Solution**: Add 220-470Ω resistor on data line near microcontroller

### LEDs Work Partially

**Problem**: First N LEDs work, rest don't
**Solution**:
- Check power supply capacity
- Look for damaged LED at cutoff point
- Add power injection every 60-100 LEDs

### Random Flickering

**Problem**: LEDs flicker randomly
**Solution**:
- Add 1000µF capacitor across power supply
- Ensure solid ground connections
- Check power supply capacity
