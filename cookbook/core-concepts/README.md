## Overview

This section covers the essential concepts you need to understand to create effective LED animations. Start with LED data structures to understand how colors are stored and manipulated, then learn about color theory to work with different color models efficiently.

Timing and frame rate control are crucial for smooth animations, and power management ensures your projects run safely and reliably.
